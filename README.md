# Fantasy-Baseball-DraftKit
Java program that keeps track of players in a Fantasy Baseball Draft

This program pulls from a JSON file a list of players in the fantasy baseball league. The program then organizes the data
of the players into tables that make it easier to keep track of stats during a draft. User's can draft players manually or
automatically, picking players and placing them on teams that they create. After being added, players can also be removed
from teams and placed back into the player pool. The program keeps track of the overall stats as well as filled positions
for each team so user's can gauage what skilled players they still need.
